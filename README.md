## WLP4 Compiler

WLP4 (pronounced "Wool P Four") is a subset of C++ standing for “Waterloo, Language, Plus, Pointers, Plus, Procedures”.
It includes functions, integers, pointers, arrays, conditional statements, and while loops. 
This WLP4 Compiler performs scanning, parsing, context-sensitive analysis, and code generation, translating WLP4 code into MIPS assembly language. 
The source code for this project is not public, if you would like to see it please email me.
